	 <h2>COVID-19</h2>
        <p>COVID-19 is the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family that causes illness
        ranging from the common cold to severe conditions such as the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe
        Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-Cov). Animals are known to share these viruses commonly. Common signs of infection include
        respiratory symptoms, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, an infection can cause
        pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. </p>
        <h2>A Brief History of the Virus</h2>
        <p>On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was formally notified about a cluster of cases of pneumonia in
        Wuhan City, home to 11 million people and the cultural and economic hub of central China. By 5 January, 59 cases were known
        and none had been fatal. Ten days later, WHO was aware of 282 confirmed cases, of which four were in Japan, South Korea and
        Thailand. There had been six deaths in Wuhan, 51 people were severely ill and 12 were in a critical condition. The virus
        responsible was isolated on 7 January and its genome shared on 12 January. The cause of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
        that became known as COVID-19 was a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The rest is history, albeit history that is constantly being
        rewritten: as of 12 May, 82,591 new cases of COVID‐19 worldwide were being confirmed daily and the death rate was over 4200 per
        day. </p>

	  <h1>Protection from the virus</h1>
    <h3>How it spread</h3>
        <p>
        SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus that spreads primarily through contact with an infected person through respiratory droplets
        generated when a person, for example, coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. The main cause
        for it's rapid spread is due to the ignorance and obliviousness of many people. The Chinese government for example, despite knowing
        about the virus earlier than everyone else, was unable to procede with measures that could potentially have prevented the expeditious
        increase in cases both nationally and globally. </p>
	  <h3>Face masks and other forms of facial protection</h3>
        <p>Masks/face shields create a physical barrier that catches droplets from infected people and prevents them from spreading as far into
        the surrounding air as they normally would. If ever you are in need to go outside, do not forget to wear a mask or any form of face protection.
        </p>
        <h3>Social Distancing</h3>
        <p>Social distancing, also called “physical distancing,” means keeping a safe space between yourself and other people who are not from your
        household. To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people who are not from your household
        in both indoor and outdoor spaces. </p>
